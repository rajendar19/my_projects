The following are the commands used in GIT and GITHUB.

The main reason we use GitHub is to get all our data/projects into source control and work with
remote repositaries.

Previously Microsoft TFS was used. It is microsoft application management suite.
The main disadvante with this is it is hard for single users as it mailny supports groups.

---> git init   ---   This initialize our repositary in the current folder.

---> git status   ---   This gives the status at any given time.

---> git add . (or) git add fileName.ext   ---   This adds/stages the file to the local repositary.

---> git add * .ext  ---   This adds/stages the files with particular extensions.

---> git commit -m "message"   ---   This commits all the changes we made to the file/folder.

---> git log   ---   This gives the commit history.

---> touch filename    ---   This is used to create new files. 

---> .gitignore    ---   This is used to ignore particular files.

Branching: This creates a copy of the code that we work on, so that the original code woll be remained as it is.

Note: The name of the main branch will asways be MASTER.
